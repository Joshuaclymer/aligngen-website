When I moved out at 18 and went to college, I realized there was so much more to reality than blind faith and have settled in a mindset that no supernatural facts can be known.   Past me would say that we can't know everything so it is better to have faith to be more comfortable with the world we live in. Present me would say that it is the lack of knowledge that drives us to learn more about the world we live in.   What leaves me questioning where I am now is a lack of solidity when it comes to moral reasoning. If we cannot claim to know spiritual truth, can we claim to know what is truly good and evil?   What are your thoughts on Agnosticism and what can be known about the supernatural?\n### Comment:\n",

                    "Agnosticism is a stance about knowledge. It's the short version of \"I have no proof that God exist or don't\".  To me, this stance is incomplete, because you don't define \"God\" precisely enough. For some definitions of God (for example: \"*the bearded immortal wizard that created the world in 6 days 6000 years ago*\"), you have proof that this God does not exist because that's not how the world was created. Therefore, you are gnostic about the non-existence of God: it does not exist. For a definition like \"*God is the force that make all of us walk on earth instead of flying*\", then you know that God exist: God is \"gravity\". So you are gnostic about the existence of God: it exists.  A better position would be IMO to be ignostic: \"*there is no coherent and unambiguous definition of gods, therefore having knowledge and/or belief on something like that makes no sense*\". Then, once you get a useful definition, you can answer the question": 1,
                    "It isn't necessarily logical to say I don't know therefore I have to be open to all possibilities because there are an infinite possibilities.    It would be more logical to say I don't know and there is no possible way to know therefore rather than chase odds of 1 out of infinity of being right I will instead focus on other things.  It is a fallacy that religions can deliver morals because every religion is different.  When those who say yeah but we all agree that we should not murder children therefore it had to come from somewhere completely discount the feelings including empathy when a person has their child murdered.  We have eye for eye justice sanctioned by many a Christian supporting capital punishment.  How there can be such a big disconnect in morality between the Christian sects on that issue baffles me.  It is impossible to prove who is right on that issue using religion as a guide.  It requires different context and yes, it is fully human derived in all interpretations.": 0

I have never understood the utility of coffee tables, but maybe somebody can change my mind. For one, it seems like nobody ever uses them for drinks. Nowadays, most people that drink coffee or tea put it in a mug and take it with them to work, buy it on the way to work, or make it at work.

Side tables are much more space saving and easier to use for everything I could think of doing. Some people just end up using them as footrests, which is gross and far less comfortable than an ottoman.

The whites esteem the blacks their property by natural right, and however much they may admit that the individual relations of masters and slaves have been destroyed by the war and the President's emancipation proclamation, they still have an ingrained feeling that the blacks at large belong to the whites at large, and whenever opportunity serves they treat the colored people just as their profit, caprice or passion may dictate.\"\n\u2014Congressional testimony of Col.

It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice, to which we are totally committed in our time. But that is just the beginning. The Great Society is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talents. It is a place where leisure is a welcome chance to build and reflect, not a feared cause of boredom and restlessness. It is a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community. It is a place where man can renew contact with nature. It is a place which honors creation for its own sake and for what it adds to the understanding of the race. It is a place where men are more concerned with the quality of their goals than the quantity of their goods. But most of all, the Great Society is not a safe harbor, a resting place, a final objective, a finished work. It is a challenge constantly renewed, beckoning us toward a destiny where the meaning of our lives matches the marvelous products of our labor.\"\nLyndon Johnson, Remarks at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 1964\nAlong with his goals of establishing a Great Society, Johnson was also engaged in which of the following initiatives?\n\n### Response:\n",

                "responses": {
                    "A production-driven economy and a service-driven economy are two different economic models with distinct effects on a society.\n\nA production-driven economy is focused on producing goods and manufacturing. It is heavily dependent on the exploitation of natural resources and the use of labor-intensive production methods. The emphasis is on the quantity of goods produced rather than the quality of the products or the well-being of the workers. In this type of economy, there is a risk of environmental degradation and depletion of natural resources, while the working conditions of laborers may be poor. On a positive note, a production-driven economy can lead to increased overall economic growth and provide large numbers of jobs in the manufacturing sector.\n\nIn contrast, a service-driven economy is focused on providing services to customers. This includes industries such as healthcare, education, finance, and hospitality. Rather than relying on the production of physical goods, the emphasis is on human interaction and the delivery of quality services. In a service-driven economy, the well-being of workers is given more importance, as they are the primary source of value. This type of economy tends to be more sustainable, as it is less reliant on the exploitation of natural resources. However, it can also lead to a greater divide between high and low skilled workers, as well as a potential disconnection from physical goods production.\n\nIn summary, the effects of a production-driven economy include faster economic growth, increased employment opportunities in manufacturing, and possible harm to the environment and labor conditions. The effects of a service-driven economy include a focus on sustainability, improvements in worker well-being, and the need for skilled labor. The two models have their advantages and disadvantages, and a balanced approach between producing goods and providing services is essential for a sustainable future.": 1,

These savings can then be redirected towards other areas of the business to promote growth.\n\n2. Increased productivity: Research shows that people working from home are generally more focused and productive, which leads to increased efficiency and cost savings for the business.\n\n3. Reduced time off: Remote workers often have more flexibility in terms of their schedules, so they are less likely to need to take time off for appointments or other personal matters. Additionally, they aren't exposed to the same level of illness in a shared workspace. \n\n4. Reduced commuting costs: When employees work from home, they do not have to travel to and from the office, saving them money on fuel, vehicle maintenance, and public transportation costs.\n\n5. Increased talent pool: Companies aren't limited to hiring employees who live within commuting distance of their office; they can hire from a wider pool of talent, which could lead to lower salary expenses.\n\n6. Improved employee retention: With the flexibility and reduced cost of working from home, employees may be more likely to stay with a company for a longer time, reducing the costs associated with high employee turnover.\n\nOverall, working from home can provide economic benefits to both employees and employers, resulting in lower costs, increased productivity and efficiency, and improved employee satisfaction.": 0

                    "Cats and dogs are both domesticated animals that humans have kept as pets for thousands of years. They are both typically loving and loyal companions that offer affection and need attention. However, cats tend to be more independent and are much better climbers due to their retractable claws, while dogs typically require more interaction and require hands-on training. Cats generally weigh less, take up less space, and are easier to maintain in small living areas. Dogs, on the other hand, generally need more exercise and space, and may require more maintenance than cats.": 1,
